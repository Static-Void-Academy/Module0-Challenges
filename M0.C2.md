## Prompt

You're working at a sign manufacturer, and your job today is to just manufacture the letters 'H' and 'h' for all your customers.

But, instead of just manually counting, you've decided to be smart about it and write a program that does this for you.

Write a program that does the following:
1. **Takes input from the user.**
2. **Checks how many times the letters 'H' and 'h' show up.**
3. **Prints out results in the following format:** `H: NUM, h: NUM`, where both `NUM` are the number of times that character shows up.

```bash
# Example Usages of Program
$ python3 h_counter.py
Input message:
This is an example sentence that I am typing to test this functionality.
H: 0, h: 3

$ python3 h_counter.py
Input message:
Honolulu, Hawaii. Seoul, South Korea. Hyderabad, India.
H: 3, h: 1
```
