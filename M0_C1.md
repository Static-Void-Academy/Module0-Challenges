# Module 0, Challenge 1 (M0.C1)

## Prompt

Your charity is requesting for you to write a program that can greet people and help point them to the appropriate rooms in the building.

1. **Start by taking their first name and then greeting them.**
2. **Next, ask them which of the following locations they'd like to go to:**
    - Cafeteria
    - Office
    - Playground
    - Restroom
3. **For whichever location picked, print out the message according to the table below:**

Location   | Message to Print
-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cafeteria  | The Cafeteria is straight ahead at the end. Enjoy! 
Office     | The Office is up the stairs and to the left. 
Playground | Our Playground is back out the main door and around the side.
Restroom   | The Restroom is down the hall and to the right before the cafeteria.

4. **But... there's a catch!** The Playground is only for children 11 and younger. So if they pick `Playground`, you should actually ask them their age first, and if they're young enough, tell them where the playground is. If not... turn them away nicely!

## Example Usage
```
$ python3 welcome.py
Please enter your name: Bob
Welcome, Bob! Where would you like to go? (Cafeteria, Office, Playground, Restroom): Restroom
The Restroom is down the hall and to the right before the cafeteria.

$ python3 welcome.py
Please enter your name: Samantha
Welcome, Samantha! Where would you like to go? (Cafeteria, Office, Playground, Restroom): Playground
Please confirm your age: 19
You do not meet the age restrictions for our playground. Sorry!
```

## Knowledge Tested
